# MyMood Journal 💛

**MyMood Journal** is a simple Python project that lets users track and reflect on their daily moods. It supports:

- Logging a mood with reason
- Viewing past mood entries
- Analyzing most common moods

This was my final project for CS106A (Code in Place 2025)


## 🚀 Features

- 📅 Daily mood logging
- 📖 View mood history
- 📊 Simple mood frequency analysis
- 📁 Data saved to `mood_log.txt`


## 🛠 How It Works

The program uses:
- `input()` simulation (for sandbox environments)
- File I/O to persist mood logs
- Lists and dictionaries for analysis
